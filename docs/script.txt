Audio introduction
Eugene:
This place is empty. Overgrown by strange plants everywhere. Not sure what they need a security guard for if the place is deserted. Hey what was that? Freeze!




Scientist 1:
It's not working! The plants are NOTHING like what they are supposed to be. Last night one of them grew a sickle like appendange and attacked my team.
Scientist 2:
Get yourself together man! Remember the stakes of this opperation! You can't just run away because of a little danger. This is for the greater good!
Scientist 1:
Listen, Douglas was on the ground bleeding. I don't want to hear it right now.
*pause* *angry stompy footsteps*
Scientist 2:
*sigh* These younger recruits may have the skills, but they certainly lack experience.



Recording in Yydrasil room
Lead Scientist:
We have known in private for some time now that we will soon face the end of this world. Many programs to preserve humanity have failed, but I am pleased to say that here we have succeeded. We have successfully nurtured a clone of the mythical tree Yygdrasil. The tree will preserve two humans encased in it through the appocolapse who will go on to be the first man and woman in the next cycle of life. As for myself, I will be leaving the facility and disapear, at least on paper. I look forward to spending my remaining days on a restful vacation, but will miss my dear collegues.
